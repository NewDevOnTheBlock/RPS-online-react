# RPS-online-react
An online rock-paper-scissors game that allows uers to battle it out, and keep track of wins and losses in real time

# Project Overview:
- This is a full-stack application that will allow two people to play rock-paper-scissors via the web browser
- This project is going to be a showcase of different development skills, while also being made strictly as a fun side project to allow random web users to battle it out with each other or a friend
- This will be an application that utilizes React on the front end and Express + Node.js for the back end, while using Tailwind to style it
- This will start as a local game vs the CPU, but will evolve to allow two local players to interact with each other, and eventually will allow for two users to play together

# Features:
- Single player mode vs. CPU
- Local Multiplayer mode
- Online multiplayer with Socket.IO
- Scoreboard and win tracking
- Mobile friendly design
- Animations and sound effects

# Tech Stack:

- Frontend: React, Tailwind 
- Backend: Express, Node
- DB (placeholder for now)
- Deployment: (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or Railway â€” when I get there)
